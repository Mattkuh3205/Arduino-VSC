Welcome to my robotic arm project, as part of my journey to becoming an embedded SWE.
I created this project from what I learned in Paul Mcwhorters Arduino series, utilizing servos and potentiometers.

The final render of the STL essentially shows what I want the arm to do. In the future, supports for the main base will be 3D printed and then weighted.
